Ive used the official validators:

- [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) to test the HTML. <br>
- [Jigsaw.w3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to test the CSS. <br>
- [JsHint](https://jshint.com/) validator was used to test the JavaScript.

No errors were found in HTML, CSS or JS.
